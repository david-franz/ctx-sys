# F11.1 Cross-Platform Desktop App

**Phase**: 11 - Commercial Desktop & Enterprise
**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: F10.3 Authentication & SSO

## Goal

Provide a "zero-config" GUI wrapper for the ctx-sys MCP server, making the tool accessible to users who are uncomfortable with CLI tools.

## Overview

The Desktop App is the primary distribution vessel for the "Pro" version. It encapsulates the Node.js runtime, the SQLite database management, and the MCP server process into a single installable binary.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Electron (Main process + Renderer)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind
- **Build System**: Electron Forge or Electron Builder
- **Auto-Update**: electron-updater (S3/GitHub Releases)

## Key Features

### 1. Tray Application / Menu Bar
- Runs in background.
- "Traffic Light" status indicator for MCP Server health.
- Quick toggle to Pause/Resume indexing (to save battery).

### 2. Project Manager
- Drag-and-drop folders to index.
- Visual progress bars for parsing/embedding.
- "re-index" button for manual sync.

### 3. Visual Graph Explorer
- Interactive node-link diagram of the codebase.
- Click a node (Function) to see its summary and connections.
- **Value**: Demonstrates the "hidden structure" of the code to the user.

### 4. Configuration Helper
- **Ollama Check**: Detect if Ollama is running. If not, offer to download/launch it.
- **Install Integrations**: One-click scripts to modify `claude_desktop_config.json` or VS Code settings.

## Security Considerations

- **Code Signing**: Must sign binaries for macOS (Notarization) and Windows (EV Cert) to avoid "Unknown Developer" warnings.
- **Sandbox**: Local execution only. Explicit permission content request for folders.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Proof of Concept**: Wrap existing CLI code in a basic Electron shell.
2. **IPC Bridge**: secure coms between UI and the `CodebaseIndexer`.
3. **Signing Pipeline**: Set up GitHub Actions to build and sign release artifacts.
4. **Distribution**: Upload artifacts to R2/S3 bucket for update checking.
