# F9.3 Support & Documentation Portal

**Phase**: 9 - Integrations & Analytics
**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: F9.2 Git Hooks

## Goal

Deflect support tickets and ensure user success through high-quality, searchable documentation and automated support workflows.

## Overview

Documentation is the product's UX for installation and troubleshooting. Given the complexity of local environments (Ollama, Node versions, OS permissions), comprehensive troubleshooting guides are essential.

## Key Components

### 1. AI-Powered Docs Search
- Eat our own dog food. Embed a widget on the doc site that uses `ctx-sys` logic to answer "How do I fix error X?" using the documentation index.

### 2. Troubleshooting Wizards
- Interactive flowcharts for common issues:
  - "Installation Failed" -> "OS?" -> "Mac" -> "Check Permissions".
  - "Ollama not found" -> "Check port 11434".

### 3. Community Forum
- **Platform**: GitHub Discussions or Discord.
- **Strategy**: Keep support public so fixes are indexed by Google.

### 4. Enterprise Support Channel
- Shared Slack Connect channels for high-paying Enterprise contracts.
- Defining SLA (Service Level Agreements) for bug fixes.

## Content Plan

- **Quickstarts**: "ctx-sys with Claude," "ctx-sys with Copilot," "ctx-sys with Vim."
- **Concepts**: Explainers for "Graph RAG", "Decision Extraction" (Marketing educational content).
- **Recipes**: "How to index a Monorepo", "Ignoring generated files."

## Implementation Plan

1. **Platform Selection**: Docusaurus or Next.js Docs (connected to F10.1).
2. **Content Migration**: Polish the `docs/phase-*` files into user-facing guides.
3. **Feedback Widget**: Simple "Was this helpful?" on every page.
