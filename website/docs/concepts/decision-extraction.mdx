# Decision Extraction

One of ctx-sys's most powerful features is automatic **decision extraction**. This page explains what decisions are, how they're captured, and why they matter.

## Why Track Decisions?

Every codebase contains implicit knowledge:

- *"We use JWT instead of sessions because the API is stateless"*
- *"The UserService is a singleton to share database connections"*
- *"We chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB for ACID compliance"*

This knowledge usually exists only in:
- The minds of developers who made the decision
- Buried in old Slack messages
- Lost commit messages
- Forgotten PR discussions

ctx-sys captures these decisions and surfaces them when relevant.

## What is a Decision?

A decision in ctx-sys has:

```typescript
interface Decision {
  id: string;
  decision: string;      // What was decided
  rationale?: string;    // Why it was decided
  alternatives?: string[]; // What was considered
  context: string;       // Surrounding discussion
  entities: string[];    // Related code entities
  sessionId: string;     // Which conversation
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### Example Decision

```json
{
  "decision": "Use Redis for session storage",
  "rationale": "Need sub-millisecond reads and automatic expiration",
  "alternatives": [
    "PostgreSQL - too slow for hot path",
    "In-memory - doesn't scale horizontally"
  ],
  "entities": ["SessionManager", "RedisClient"],
  "sessionId": "session_abc123"
}
```

## How Decisions Are Extracted

### 1. Conversation Analysis

When you discuss code with an AI assistant, ctx-sys monitors for:

- **Decision markers**: "Let's use", "We should", "I'll implement"
- **Rationale markers**: "because", "so that", "to ensure"
- **Alternative discussions**: "instead of", "rather than", "compared to"

### 2. Pattern Recognition

Common decision patterns:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Technology choice | "Use TypeScript instead of JavaScript" |
| Architecture pattern | "Implement the repository pattern" |
| Naming convention | "Prefix interfaces with 'I'" |
| Error handling | "Throw errors rather than return null" |
| API design | "Use REST, not GraphQL" |

### 3. Entity Linking

Decisions are automatically linked to related code:

```
Decision: "Add retry logic to the API client"
     │
     ├── Links to: ApiClient class
     ├── Links to: retryWithBackoff() function
     └── Links to: config.retryCount setting
```

## Using Decisions

### Query Past Decisions

Ask about specific topics:

```bash
ctx decisions "authentication"
```

Or through an AI assistant:

> "What decisions have been made about the database schema?"

### View Decision History

```bash
ctx decisions --all
```

### Search in Context

When querying for code, related decisions are automatically included:

```
Query: "How does error handling work?"

Results:
  1. ErrorHandler class (src/errors/handler.ts)
  2. handleApiError() function
  3. Decision: "Use custom error classes for each domain"
  4. Decision: "Log all errors to CloudWatch"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Explicit When Deciding

When working with AI assistants, clearly state decisions:

> "Let's use the factory pattern for creating validators because we need to support multiple input types"

This is more likely to be captured than:

> "I think factory might work here"

### 2. Record Alternatives

Mention what you considered and rejected:

> "I considered using inheritance but chose composition because it's more flexible for testing"

### 3. Link to Code

Reference specific files or functions:

> "The AuthMiddleware should validate JWT tokens before each request"

### 4. Update When Things Change

When a decision changes, explicitly state the new decision:

> "We're switching from JWT to session cookies because we need revocation support"

## Decision Retrieval

### Automatic Inclusion

By default, relevant decisions are included in context queries:

```json
{
  "retrieval": {
    "includeDecisions": true,
    "maxDecisions": 5
  }
}
```

### Decision-Only Queries

Query specifically for decisions:

```bash
ctx query --type decisions "API design"
```

### Filter by Time

Find recent decisions:

```bash
ctx decisions --since "1 week ago"
```

## Privacy and Control

### What's Captured

- Decisions from conversations with AI assistants
- Only when ctx-sys is connected

### What's NOT Captured

- Personal conversations
- Content outside connected tools
- Anything before ctx-sys was installed

### Data Location

Decisions are stored locally in `.ctx-sys/ctx-sys.db`:

```bash
# View decision count
ctx stats decisions

# Export decisions
ctx export decisions --format json > decisions.json
```
